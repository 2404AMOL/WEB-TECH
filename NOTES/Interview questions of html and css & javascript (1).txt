10.What is the difference between Html5 application cache and regulate Html browser cache?
Ans. The new HTML5 specification allows browsers to prefetch some or all of website assets such as HTML files, images, CSS, JavaScript, and so on, while the client is connected. It is not necessary for the user to have accessed this content previously, for fetching this content. In other words, application cache can prefetch pages that have not been visited at all and are thereby unavailable in the regular browser cache. Prefetching files can speed up the site’s performance, though you are of course using bandwidth to download those files initially.


11. What is the use of LocalStorage in HTML5?
Ans. Before HTML5 LocalStores was done with cookies. Cookies are not very good for large amounts of data, because they are passed on by every request to the server, so it was very slow and in-effective.
In HTML5, the data is NOT passed on by every server request, but used ONLY when asked for. It is possible to store large amounts of data without affecting the website’s performance.and The data is stored in different areas for different websites, and a website can only access data stored by itself.
And for creating localstores just need to call localStorage object like below we are storing name and address.
   <script type=”text/javascript”>
localStorage.name=”ABC”;
localStorage.address=”New Delhi India.”;
document.write(localStorage.address);
  </script>

placeholder Specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field.

20. Is it possible for a web page to have multiple <header> and <footer> elements?
Ans. Yes, a webpage can have many <header> and <footer> elements. Both tags are specifically designed to serve their respective purposes with respect to their parent section.

Hence, not only the page <body> must have the <header> and <footer> tags, but also does every <article> and <section> elements. Although a <footer> element might not be always necessary for every <article> and <section> tags, a <header> element must always be there.

21. What is the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements:
Ans. i) <article>
     This HTML5 element is intended to have a self-contained composition, being logically independent and capable to be created outside the web page without losing the concerned meaning. Suitable examples for the <article> element are blog posts, news snippets, and release updates.

ii) <footer>
  We use the <footer> element to hold information meant to appear at the end of a particular section of a web page. Typically, it contains additional information about the section. Suitable examples for this HTML5 element include an author bio and helpful links.

iii) <header>
   This essential HTML5 element contains introductory as well as navigation information about a certain section or the body of a web page. Suitable examples for the <header> element are author name, publication date, number of views, and table of contents.

Canvas has no provision for API animation. SVG, on the contrary, is capable of API animation.

23.What will happen if the doctype is not specified in an HTML web page?

Some disadvantages of HTML5 are:


Only modern versions of the browsers support HTML5. Not all users use the latest version of browsers.

Many features are still not stable and are in the development stage.

Due to licensing issues, the rich media is compressed into multiple formats to be compatible with most browsers.
