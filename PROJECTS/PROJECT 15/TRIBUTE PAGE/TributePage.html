                                after graduation. His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he

                                not convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969,
                                where he was the project director of India's first satellite vehicle launch. The
                                satellite
                                vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980.
                                Kalam
                                received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed two
                                projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic
                                missiles from the successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira

                                and sought secret funds for these aerospace projects. His research and immense knowledge
                                brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.


                                Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 and
                                served at the same post for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal

                                which according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature of India in 20
                                years, taking it from a developing to a developed nation. The plan envisioned the
                                progress
                                of the nation by adopting advanced technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and

                                Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography -Kalam as the 11th President of India
                                Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July
                                2002
                                to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive
                                margin of votes. National Democratic Alliances‚Äô nominated him to be president and it was
                                supported by Samajwadi Party and National Congress Party. He was lovingly called as
                                peoples‚Äô
                                president as he had done uncountable works for the welfare of the people and through the
                                entire country.


                                He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if
                                that
                                was tough or sensitive or highly controversial. The ‚Äúoffice of profit‚Äù is perhaps the
                                hard
                                Act that he had to sign. The ‚Äúoffice of profit‚Äù, according to the English Act of
                                Settlement
                                in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a professional set up under the royal
                                family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a pension from the prince
                                has
                                the right to work for the of the ‚ÄúHouse of Commons‚Äù. This will allow the royal family to
                                have zero influence on the administrative conditions.


                                He had also become one of the most talked-about presidents Rule in 2005 for imposing the
                                Presidents‚Äô rule in Bihar. Kalam expressed his wish to take up the position one more

                                but then later changed his mind.


                                After taking farewell from the office, he shifted and commenced his career as a visiting

                                presence and knowledge. Sir Kalam served as chancellor Indian Institute of Space Science

                                a boat owner, and his mother, Ashiamma, was a homemaker. He started working at a young

                                hardworking and bright student with a strong desire to learn things. He used to study
                                for hours, especially mathematics. He completed his schooling from Rameswaram Elementary

                                Madras (now Chennai) and joined the Madras Institute of Technology and studied aerospace
                                engineering. His dream was to become a fighter pilot but he was ranked ninth while the
                                IAF offered only eight slots. He remained a bachelor.

                                Kalam rose from obscurity through his personal and professional struggles and his work
                                on Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag missiles became a household name in India and
